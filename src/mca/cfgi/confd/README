1. set environ to support confd by sourcing confdrc or confdrc.tcsh from the confd install dir

2. build orcm. This will compile and install the yang code in $prefix/yang

4. start the confd daemon
    confd --addloadpath $prefix/yang

5. start the confd cli and enter config
confd_cli -C
config
orcm
 install
  app bgp
   exec bgp-client
    path foo/bar/bgp-client.exe
   !
   exec bgp-shim
    path foo/bar/jeff/bgp-shim.exe
   !
  !
 !
 run
  app-instance debug-bgp
   app-name bgp
   exec bgp-client

===============================================
Getting confd:
 /ws/schaefer-sjc/Tail-f

and pick the release you want (i.e. the latest).  Copy the appropriate
installer ".bin" file (i686 or x86_64) to the virtual linux box.  You
might also want the examples and doc tar files.  Then run the installer
script, pointing at a destination directory, e.g.

 sh /tmp/confd-3.2.1.linux.i686.installer.bin /usr/confd

If you then source the installed setup script (assuming you use a Bourne
shell):

 . /usr/confd/confdrc

you'll be able to start the daemon, run the CLI, etc.
