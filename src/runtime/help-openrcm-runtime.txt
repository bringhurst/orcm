[orcm_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like orcm_init failed for some reason; your application is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that an application can
fail during orcm_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
OpenRCM developer):

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %s (%d) instead of ORTE_SUCCESS
#
[hnp-filename-bad]
We are unable to parse the filename where contact info for the
CM to be contacted was to be found. The option we were given was:

--%s %s

This appears to be missing the required ':' following the
keyword "file". Please use the --help option for more information on
the correct format for this command line option.
#
[hnp-filename-access]
We are unable to access the filename where contact info for the
CM to be contacted was to be found. The filename we were given was:

File: %s

Please use the --help option for more information on
the correct format for this command line option.
#
[hnp-file-bad]
We are unable to read the CM contact info from the
given filename. The filename we were given was:

FILE: %s

Please use the --help option for more information on
the correct format for this command line option.
#
[hnp-uri-bad]
We are unable to correctly parse the CM's contact info. The uri we were given was:

URI: %s

Please remember that this is *not* a standard uri, but
a special format used internally by OpenRCM for communications. It can
best be generated by simply directing the CM to put its
uri in a file, and then giving us that filename.
